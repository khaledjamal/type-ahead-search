# Type-Ahead Search Field

This is a web application that demonstrates the use of an interactive type-ahead search field. It enables the user to type a search keyword then immediately see results, without requiring the user to press the "Enter" key or click a button.

The application is written using Angular 4 framework, which is based on TypeScript.  TypeScript is a primary language for Angular application development. It is a superset of JavaScript with design-time support for type safety and tooling. Browsers can't execute TypeScript directly. Typescript must be "transpiled" into JavaScript using a special compiler.

This application is meant to demonstrate skills in converting a provided image into a web application that is based on JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In addition to Angular, it demonstrates the use of RxJS, Flexbox and icons from Google Material and Font Awesome libraries.

The application searches for client data, which is currently hardcoded in the frontend application. The application does not communicate with a backend to retrieve data.

Before installing the application, make sure to have node.js and git installed on your computer.

### Steps to install and run the application:
- git clone https://github.com/khaledjamal/type-ahead-search.git
- cd type-ahead-search
- npm install	
- npm start
